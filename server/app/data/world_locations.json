It serves primarily as a farming community but has ambitions to grow into a larger trade center. The town is named after a legendary incident where a boy defended a river ford with only a dagger against lizardmen. Daggerford is dominated by the ducal castle and is a common stop for caravans and adventurers. While generally pastoral, it often faces threats from nearby wilderness areas like the Lizard Marsh and the High Moors.",

A local militia, composed of citizens who receive training, provides defense.",

It connects the mineral-rich lands of the North, the merchant kingdoms of Amn and Calimshan to the south, the Inner Sea kingdoms to the east, and the myriad sea kingdoms to the west. Waterdeep is a cosmopolitan city, with a primarily human population but also significant numbers of dwarves, elves (especially moon elves), halflings, half-elves, and gnomes, fostering a worldly and respectful culture among its inhabitants. The city sprawls northward from the sea, spreading along the flanks of Mount Waterdeep, an ancient dwarven citadel riddled with passages and tunnels, many still inhabited by various creatures. Waterdeep's authority extends for roughly 30 to 40 miles beyond its walls, encompassing a total population of over a million souls, though the city proper houses around 140,000. It's a city of great wealth, constant activity, and stark contrasts, known for both its opportunities and its intrigues.",
