        "the_ritual": "The Ritual of Draconic Investiture: Severin and Rezmir, having discovered the Wyrmstone and its properties, recognize its potential to create a powerful weapon for the Cult. They devise a ritual to imbue a dragon egg with the artifact's essence, hoping to create a champion infused with the souls and power of the fallen dragons. They gather in a hidden chamber within the Well of Dragons, a place of ancient draconic power. The Wyrmstone, pulsating with stolen energies, is placed at the center of a ritual circle. Chanting in ancient Draconic, Severin and Rezmir channel their magic and magic items (Hazirawn, Black Dragon Mask, Red Dragon Mask, Staff of the Magi, Dragon's Wrath, Helm of Brilliance, Amulet of the Planes, Rod of Absorption, The Dragon's Eye) into the artifact, forcing it to release a surge of power into a carefully selected black dragon egg. The egg absorbs the energy, its shell cracking and reforming as the Wyrmstone's essence merges with the nascent dragon within. Vuthausk hatches, imbued with the combined power of the artifact and the trapped souls, a tool of the Cult – or so they believe. Severin departs to find other Dragon Masks with Varramzord the White Wyrmspeaker. Rezmir departs with Langdedrosa to amass her hoard of wealth and nurture her egg in the hidden hatchery.",
